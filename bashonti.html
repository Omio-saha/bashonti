        <h3>Kacchi biryani</h3>
        <small> <strong> Author , editor and writer:</strong> <i> Omio saha</i></small>
        <p>Kacchi Mutton Biryani is a delicious rice dish where tender goat or lamb meat pieces are marinated with lots of fried onions, whole spices, fresh herbs and yoghurt. This marinated meat sits on the bottom of
             the pot topped with half-cooked rice which is drizzled with saffron-infused water and more fried onions and fresh mint leaves. Sealed and slow-cooked in an oven or on stove-top to a delicious aromatic finger-licking 
             biryani that you may serve with some kachumber, salad, and if you are like us, more pappadoms! Naturally, I am very passionate about highlighting Bangladeshi cooking.  When I started to think about my guest post on 
             Chef Dennis’s blog, Kachchi biryani appeared to be the perfect dish to share with all of you, as I would have prepared if I were to welcome each of you in a large group to my home over dinner.  Kachchi biryani is usually
              a featured dish for weddings and social gatherings and celebrations.  Layers of meat, rice and potatoes are infused with warm and delectable blends of aromatic spices to prepare kachchi biryani.  Whether it is a tender 
              piece of mutton, potato, alubokhara(prune) or the rice itself, each spoonful is a mouthwatering surprise.  I find this grand biryani to have lesser prep time because all the ingredients are put in layers and then in the
               oven instead of cooking the rice and meat separately and then combining. To know more ...... </p>

        <h3>Shorshe ilish</h3>
        <small><strong> Author , editor and writer:</strong><i> Omio saha</i></small>
        <p>Ilish or Hilsa, a fish that brings happiness, as fish that is an emotion, a fish that hold a very special place in every Bengali’s life, a fish that brings taste, flavour and aroma along with it, a fish that is expensive but
             worth every penny, a fish that is the Queen of all fishes. Bringing Ilish home is like bringing home a celebration. Bengalis across the world may have different preference and taste, but there is hardly any Bengali alive on 
             earth who doesn’t love Ilish.I hail from Silchar, a place situated in Northeastern part of India and quite near to Indo-Bangladesh border. Which means, when the season is on, we have Ilish in abundance in the markets. As I moved
              to South India 8 years back, Ilish became almost a rare luxury. From past two years we have been deprived of this fish and could only relish if we pay visit to our native. It is two years now I have started this blog and could not
               manage to have a single recipe of Ilish because of its unavailability. That made me sad, very sad. Being a Bengali food blogger and that too a Sylheti Bengali, not having a single Ilish dish here has been disheartening. While, we
                the Bengalis never think of money when it comes to buying Ilish. But yes, money cannot always buy Ilish, availability matters. To know more .....

    <h3>pizza</h3>
        <small><strong> Author , editor and writer:</strong><i> Omio saha</i></small>
        <P>Pizza, favored by all ages, dates back to 1889. Pizza, garnished with Mozzarella and tomatoes, was normally known as the dish for poor people until it became a famous dish for the wealthy when 
            Queen Margherita had it as a meal as well. Pizza, with sauces and spices such as basil and garlic added later on, gets recognition by other nations with the arrival of Italian immigrants to the
            United States.  The spread of pizza all over the world is due to the initiatives of the Americans.At that time in Italy, pizzas were made with Mozzarella and tomatoes however later on were served 
            with different ingredients used today. Pizza, which has spread quickly outside of the USA, has become a favorite dish for consumers of all ages. The most important point of making a pizza is the dough 
            and the cooking method. Although pizza dough is a changing concept based on different palates, pizzaiolos  suggest that the dough should be as thin as possible. It is believed that a more delicious pizza
             can be obtained by focusing more on toppings rather than the dough. The pizza dough is as important as baking it. After all the ingredients have been added, the pizza should be placed on a higher rack in
              the oven. Thus, ingredients are cooked at the same time as the dough. You can also eat the pizza only with spices or sauces such as ketchup, mayonnaise, Ranch and mustard. To know more.......</P>
